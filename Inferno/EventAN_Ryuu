[Midboss]My house got taken over by a weird god but...
I decided that this is also your fault.

[Enemy]Welcome to mine hideout.\n
Pleased to have you, Ryuu-kun.
[Ryuu]I didn't see you lately so to this place I thought youâ€¦\n
What do you plan in taking over the demons' den?
[Enemy]You want to know?! I'll tell you!!\n
Hmm, that is!!!
......\n
Uhhhm, that is...
[Ryuu]So, you cannot think of anything as expected.
[Enemy]Wrong!!\n
I'll do my best to think now so wait a bit!!
[Ryuu]Seriously...\n
Hey, don't say anything stupid and come back.
[Enemy]Ehh! Ehh! That's not a chaance!
After I went through the pain of taking such cave...!!
...oh right!!
Stay inside with me too, Ryuu!!
Staying inside is fun!!
'cause reflecting on yourself is niice!
[Ryuu]I have no such hobby.
Today I will get you to come back by all costs.
[Enemy]Nuohhh, I definitely don't wanna go!!\n
I won't gooooo!!
If you wanna go and take me outside,\n
you gotta do it by force!!!

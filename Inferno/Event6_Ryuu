I have come this far in the end.\n
Is the Devil around here?
[Enemy]So you finally arrived!!\n
I've been waiting!!
It got nearly tiring to wait, on my end.\n
'twas just the right matter! Hahahaha!
[Ryuu]You are the Devil, right.\n
The looks are such.
[Enemy]Indeed I am the Devil.\n
Were you perhaps able to enjoy the trip to Hell?
[Ryuu]That being I enjoyed it but,\n
I did not think it was painful all the way.
[Enemy]Hm...that's unfortunate.\n
Although this will turn into your final abode.
